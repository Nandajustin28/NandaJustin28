## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Nanda. I'm studying Biomedical Sciences and BioBusiness with a knack in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I believe that the future is interdisciplinary and that the integration of Biology and computing will be a significant part of the world.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a collaborative Hackathon, possibly learning front-end and essential back-end frameworks and API systems to implement Artificial Intelligence.
